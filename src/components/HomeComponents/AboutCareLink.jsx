              We are deeply touched seeing the helpless people of Bangladesh,
              the least developed country.Still, SPAR, or Society for
              Participatory Action and Reflection, has been working in the field
              of humanitarian services since 2009. So that we can provide
              helpless people with a peaceful life.

              We can only build a better world if all of us live happily.
              Although we know it is very hard to accomplish this task, we try
              hard every day to do something for the suffering soul. Our
              teamwork becomes more effective when you join us in this
              humanitarian project.

              It becomes very hard for us alone to support those huge amounts of
              vulnerable people. For this reason, we welcome you to be a part of
              our human services. Letâ€™s advance each day with the vision of
              serving humanity. Thank you all!
