              We are moved by the struggles of helpless people in Bangladesh,
              one of the least developed countries. We have been dedicated to
              providing them with a more peaceful life through our humanitarian
              work.
            </p>

              A better world is only possible when everyone can live happily â€”
              though we know this goal is not easy to achieve. Our efforts
              become stronger when you join us.
            </p>
            <p className="">
              Supporting so many vulnerable people alone is challenging. That is
              why we invite you to stand with us. Move forward each day with a
              vision to serve humanity.
